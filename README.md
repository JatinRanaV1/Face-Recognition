# Face-Recognition

OpenCV based face recognition system that can detect and recognize multiple faces in an image if stored in database.

First we need to create directories for known faces and unknown faces (if you want to scan faces in stored images). I used directories known_faces and unkown_faces. But you can create as per your requirement.
We also need to create sub_directories for each known_face (ofcourse storing atleast one recognizable picture for each known face) in known_faces directory.
